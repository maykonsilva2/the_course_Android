In kotlin, *unsigned integer types are used when you need to work with non-negative numbers. They are particularly useful when you need the full range od a number type for positive values, such as when dealing with binary data or performing arithmetic operations where you expect only positive results.

| Type   | Size(bits) | Min value | Max value                            |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| UByte  | 8          | 0         | 255                                  |
| UShort | 16         | 0         | 65,535                               |
| UInt   | 32         | 0         | 4,294,967,295 ((2)^32 - 1)           |
| ULong  | 64         | 0         | 18,446,744,073,709,551,615((2)^64 -1 |

````kotlin
    val aByte: UByte = 255u // Remember to always include the `u` suffix for unsigned integers in kotlin.
````

NOTE: Unsigned types support most of the operations of their signed counterparts. However, care must be taken when converting between signed and unsigned types to avoid unexpected behavior.
As of Kotlin 1.5, the unsigned integer types and their operations are stable, but unsigned arrays and operations on them are still in Beta and require opting in with the @ExperimentalUnsignedTypes annotation1.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use unsigned integers in a function:

````Kotlin

@ExperimentalUnsignedTypes
fun calculateChecksum(bytes: UByteArray): UInt {
    var sum: UInt = 0u
    for (byte in bytes) {
        sum += byte.toUInt()
    }
    return sum
}
